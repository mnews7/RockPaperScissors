# RockPaperScissors
A basic rock paper scissors app I've been working on.

Nothing fancy. Start displays a picture of what the opponent is going to play and you have up to 5 seconds
to choose the correct counter. The timer gets shorter by 500ms each round until it reaches a minimum.

You keep going until you mess up!
